# Invoicing Software for Online Businesses (ISOB) Project
# Overview

While many professionals and companies had been furloughed due to our pandemic crisis, launching a small business is catching a lot of attention for it does not only give you the ability to work anywhere, but also the finacial flexibility when it comes to starting a business online. But as technology advances, it is important for these online businesses to be familiar with how social media and Internet works to make sure that their users/customers can receive the best service even if it's just online. 

One way of doing this is by creating an invoice system for your online business. It aims to record and itemize a transaction between the seller and the customer. This includes an automated program for accepting orders that shows the total consumption and the recorded no. of items ordered. Based on the receipt, the conditions of the transaction are specified in the invoice, as well as information on the various payment options. In the case of this project, specific details about the mode of payment will be shown along with the bill

Moreover, the language that we focused on for building and deploying the software is Python, ATOM and PyCharm. Weâ€™ll use it to program both the browser (aka the client) and the server.

# Key Points

The following functions that you need to understand will be covered in this software:

* User Login System
    
    * used to check the username and passwords stored in the user_details.txt file

    * the opening method and allows the user to pull up the login and register menu
    
These methods help the program to program to provide concrete data on the performance of the business in general.
