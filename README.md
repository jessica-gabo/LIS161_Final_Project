# Overview

While many professionals and companies had been furloughed due to our pandemic crisis, launching a small business is catching a lot of attention for it does not only give you the ability to work anywhere, but also the finacial flexibility when it comes to starting a business online.

One way of doing this is by creating an invoice system for your online business. It aims to record and itemize a transaction between the seller and the customer.

Based on the receipt, te conditions of the transaction are specified in the invoice, as well as information on the various payment options. But, in this project (i-assume ba na online ang payment method)

In this project, the language that we focused on for building and deploying the software is Python and ATOM. Weâ€™ll use it to program both the browser (aka the client) and the server.

# Key Points

The following functions that you need to understand will be covered in this software:
